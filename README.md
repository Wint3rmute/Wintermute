## 🏗️ Build

- Install [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/)
- `lilypond wintermute.ly`

## ⭐ Extras

### 🎵 Play MIDI generated by LilyPond

#### Using Qsynth

- Install Qsyth and any sound found you like
- Install your distro's package providing the `pmidi` command
- Launch Qsynch and configure the sound font
- Run `pmidi wintermute.midi`

By using this approach, you can simultaneously connect a MIDI
keyboard and have QSynth play both the notes from your keyboard
and the LilyPond-generated midi file.

#### Using Timidity

- Install and configure [`timidity++`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Timidity%2B%2B)
- Compile the notes
- Run `timidity wintermute.midi`


### 🤖 Auto build and auto play

- Install [`entr`](https://eradman.com/entrproject/)
- Run the `autobuild` script from the repository
- Try the [`zathura` pdf viewer](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/zathura), it reloads the PDF file automatically and supports theming
